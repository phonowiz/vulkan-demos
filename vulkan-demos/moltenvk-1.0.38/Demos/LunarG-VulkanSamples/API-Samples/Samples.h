/** 
 * Loads the appropriate sample code, as indicated by the appropriate compiler build setting below.
 *
 * To select a sample to run, define one (and only one) of the macros below, either by adding
 * a #define XXX statement at the top of this file, or more flexibily, by adding the macro value
 * to the Preprocessor Macros (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) compiler setting.
 *
 * To add a compiler setting, select the project in the Xcode Project Navigator panel, 
 * select the Build Settings panel, and add the value to the Preprocessor Macros 
 * (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) entry.
 *
 * If you choose to add a #define statement to this file, be sure to clear the existing macro
 * from the Preprocessor Macros (aka GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS) compiler setting in Xcode.
